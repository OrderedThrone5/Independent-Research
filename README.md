# Independent Research
These are personal research projects I conducted in high school. While everything was under a supervisor, the project was by me or my lab mates. 

## Bioplastics
I began my personal research journey with bioplastics, developing a more biodegradable alternative to conventional plastics through various chemical processes. My team and I advanced this project to the final stage of the New York City Science Fair (TERRA), where we won 1st place in Environmental Sciences and qualified for the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF). At ISEF, our project earned recognition from NOAA and placed 4th in Environmental Sciences among hundreds of competing projects from around the world.

## Carbon Capture Research

My second project was entirely my own creation. Drawing inspiration from Klaus S. Lackner's work on artificial trees, I developed a more portable carbon capture system that went on to win the New York State Science Fair. I conducted this research in my basement, encapsulating a cylindrical object coated with silica gel and amine compounds in an airtight container. I pumped CO2 into the chamber and measured how much was absorbed overnight, demonstrating the feasibility of scaled-down carbon capture technology.

## Whats next?
I hope to continue my research experience under a professor, maybe going into AI or any other field.
